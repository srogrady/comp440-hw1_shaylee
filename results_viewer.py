"""Results Viewer.

Builds one self-contained HTML page comparing four rankings of the tags on each of your ten
movies, and on the twenty least-rated movies the judge was asked about.  Per movie it shows
the counts, your own order, the
judge's order and your `score()` order, one after another; then the tags people applied to the
movie; then the biggest disagreements between `score()` and the judge.  Open the page in a
browser; --text prints the same content to a terminal.

The `Your score()` column ranks only the tags the judge also rated, so that every column on the
page covers the same set.  It is not your score's own top ten over all of the movie's tags.

    uv run python results_viewer.py            # writes movie_results.html
    uv run python results_viewer.py --text     # the same content as plain text

Your ten movies come from the "My ten movies" slot in `WRITEUP.md`, one movie to a line with
the movieId first.  Your own order comes from the "My own order of the ten most-used tags"
slot, where each movie is one line of the form

    296: quentin tarantino, nonlinear, hit men, dark comedy

with the tags best first.  Both slots are read as bare lines: no bullets, no numbering.  A
bulleted or numbered list reads as nothing, and the page says so.  A movie with no line in the
order slot shows as not written yet.  `agreement.py` holds the parser for the order slot and
this file imports it, so the page and the agreement number read the same lines.

This is a first draft.  It hides things you need in order to read the four rankings, and
finding out what, from the page itself, is part of the assignment.
